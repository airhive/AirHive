# AirHive
What if we had all the air pollution data we need?

We found out that there aren't enough pollution sensors around the world to get all the data we need to make high-resolution predictions.

To solve this problem we have designed a network of cheap IOT devices that can be placed everywhere.
This network, in case of an emergency like a gas leak, or a wave of pollution can predict, using a neural network, air's most probable path and warn the users through our app.

Our data will be available to everyone through APIs, so that developers can use our data in ways that we can't even imagine.

Furthermore our app and our website will show users which is the current level of air pollution nearby and sensibilize them about air pollution.
